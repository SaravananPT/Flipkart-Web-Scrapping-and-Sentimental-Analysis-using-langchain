Problem Statement:

The goal of this project is to develop an automated system for collecting and analyzing
product reviews from Flipkart. By leveraging web scraping techniques and sentiment
analysis, the project aims to generate data-driven product recommendations. This
involves several key tasks:

1. Web Scraping: Develop a scraper to extract product reviews from Flipkart, focusing
on various product categories such as electronics, clothing, and home appliances.
2. Data Cleaning and Structuring: Process and structure the scraped data to ensure it
is suitable for analysis.
3. Sentiment Analysis: Implement sentiment analysis on the collected reviews to
determine the overall customer sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) for each
product.
4. Product Recommendation: Use the results of the sentiment analysis to recommend
top products in each category.
5. Visualization and Reporting: Create visual representations of the data and compile
a comprehensive report detailing the analysis process, findings, and
recommendations.

The project provides learners with an opportunity to apply their skills in web scraping,
data processing, and natural language processing, while also gaining experience in
using LangChain for generating meaningful product recommendations. By the end of
the project, learners should be able to:

• Efficiently collect and process large volumes of data from e-commerce websites.
• Apply sentiment analysis to understand customer opinions.
• Generate actionable insights and recommendations based on data analysis.
• Present their findings through clear visualizations and detailed documentation
